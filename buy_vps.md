# 1- Where to buy VPS

The first thing that is needed to participate in Node Testnets is a VPS server

In order to buy a VPS ( Cloud Server), I introduce several good (in my opinion) foreign & Iranian providers with and without crypto payment with brief information

| Rank | Provider |   Payment Method   | Discription                     |
| :-------- | :-------- | :------- | :-------------------------------- |
| 1      | Hetznr      | `Credit card - need KYC` | `Best Hosting , not very cheap`  [auction servers](https://www.hetzner.com/sb/) (min. $30) are good |
| 2      | Contabo      | `Credit card - need KYC` | `Cheap but for a very few nodes we had bandwidth issues` |
| 3      | [Hostbrr](https://my.hostbrr.com/order/forms/a/NTMxNw==)      | `Crypto` | `Cheap to Normal pricing, good performance` |
| 4     | [PQhosting](https://pq.hosting/?from=687947)     | `Crypto, You might need KYC` | `Good performance and some cheap servers` |
| 5     | [Aeza](https://aeza.net/?ref=392339)     | `Crypto` | `Good for hourly servers, or you might findaa good server simetimes` |

# 2- What system to buy
Before buying a VPS, we must consider several components to choose the required system

* `CPU`: Usually, 4core to 16core
* `Ram`: Usually, 4GB to 32GB
* `HDD`, `SSD`: Projects always consider the hard disk of the Nodes to be higher than required. In few nodes such as `Prover` or `Validator in Active-set` maybe a lot of hard disk is needed. Minimum is better to be `60` 
* `Operating-system` must be `Ubuntu`, `Ubuntu 22` is usually compatible with every project
* VPS must be ipv4 and must NOT be NAT
